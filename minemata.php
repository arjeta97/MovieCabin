<h1>Minemata</h1>
<p>
Firstly I was so glad to see a movie at the cinema after all this time. Secondly I am glad that Johnny is back.
Before I write my thoughts for the movie I'd like to give some background informations for Minamata.
Minamata is a town located in Japan. In 1908 a chemical company was opened by Chisso Corporation. The company grew and prospered through the years. All that came with a tremendously huge cost, not monetary. All the chemical waste was released into Minamata bay, polluting the environment. During 1951 up until 1968 methylmercury which is organic mercury was also released into Minamata bay and that is extremely toxic. In this case methylmercury was accumulated by fishes which was also consumed by the local population and that led to mercury poisoning.
Minamata disease is a neurological disease caused by mercury poisoning.
Now let's talk about the movie.
All in all, it is a good one and I would recommend it to everyone.
The movie starts by showing us bits of Eugene Smith, a famous photographer who hadn't age that well and seemed as if he had lost all hopes for life. He meets Aileen a girl from Minamata, who tries to convince Eugene to go down to Minamata and help to make their case big, because the local government wasn't doing anything about that and people were dying and get sick everyday. He accepts and so it begins a journey of challenges, heartbreaking moments where you have to see how people struggle and are in misery because people are blinded by money.
The movie has really nice colours and I do like the dialogue although there might be some little moments where it's isn't very organic but that wasn't really a problem for me.
The peak of the movie was definitely Tomoko and Mother in the Bath. Thats probably one of the most beautiful and terrifying shots I have ever seen.
If you have a chance, check it out. You won't regret it.
